### What is Git?
Git is a modern versioning tool that has become an industry standard among developers. Individuals, startups and corporations use it on a daily basis. Git offers a simple simultaneous collaboration with more people on different parts of a project. You won't face the issue of disrupting each other's work or not being able to access the latest versions. The collaboration on a project can also be improved using Gitlab, a platform for the design, development and running of software projects.
